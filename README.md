# WikiVis - In development

### Inspired by [RealPython's](https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/) tutorial

### About

This project aims to provide a way to visualize a wiki article by displaying its key words using graphs. The backend will crawl several relevant entries with Scrapy/BautifulSoup and I'll be using D3 to do node graphs.
